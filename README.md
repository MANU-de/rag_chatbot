1. requirements.txt
   langchain
   langchain-google-genai
   faiss-cpu
   python-dotenv
   langchainhub
   
Install these: pip install -r requirements.txt   

2. .env file (Create this in rag_chatbot_project/)
     GOOGLE_API_KEY= ""

3. documents/ folder and sample documents

    Create a folder named documents in rag_chatbot_project/.
      documents/project_alpha.txt (see code)
      documents/company_info.txt  (see code)

4. utils/ingest.py
    This script will handle loading documents, splitting them, creating embeddings, and storing them in FAISS.
    (see code)
    Run this script once to create your vector store: python utils/ingest.py
   
5. main.py
    This is the main chatbot application.
    (see code)

How to Run:
 Set up API Key: Make sure your .env file has the API_KEY.
 Ingest Documents: - Navigate to the rag_chatbot_project directory in your terminal.
                     Run: python utils/ingest.py
                     This will create a vectorstore_db folder containing the FAISS index.
 Run the Chatbot:  - In the same terminal, run: python main.py
                     You can now ask questions! 

 Sample Queries to Test: 
    Specific information from project_alpha.txt:
       You: What is Project Alpha?
       You: What programming language is used for Project Alpha?
       You: Who is the project lead for Alpha?

   Specific information from company_info.txt:
       You: When was Innovatech Solutions founded?
       You: What products does Innovatech Solutions offer?
       You: Who is the CEO of Innovatech?

   Information that might require combining or inference (RAG helps ground this):
       You: Tell me about Innovatech's work with AI. (Should primarily pull from company_info.txt)

   Questions outside the documents' scope:
        You: What is the weather like today? (The bot should ideally say it doesn't know or can't answer based on the provided context).
        You: Who is the president of the United States?


  Explanation and Key Concepts:

  Document Ingestion (utils/ingest.py):
      - DirectoryLoader & TextLoader: Load .txt files from the documents folder.
        RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter: Breaks down large documents into smaller, manageable chunks. This is crucial because LLMs have context window limits, and embeddings work best on smaller,    semantically coherent text segments.
        OpenAIEmbeddings: Converts text chunks into numerical vectors (embeddings) that capture their semantic meaning.
        FAISS: A library for efficient similarity search on these vectors. FAISS.from_documents() creates the vector store, and save_local() persists it. load_local() retrieves it.

  RAG Pipeline (main.py):
      - Load LLM: ChatOpenAI initializes the language model.
        Load Vector Store: The pre-built FAISS index is loaded.
        Retriever: vectorstore.as_retriever() creates an object that can find documents in the vector store similar to a given query. search_kwargs={"k": 3} means it will retrieve the top 3 most  relevant chunks.
        Prompt Template: This is critical. It instructs the LLM on how to behave.
          {context}: Placeholder where LangChain will insert the relevant document chunks retrieved from FAISS.
          {question}: Placeholder for the user's question.
          The instructions ("Use only the following pieces of context...", "If you don't know...") are key to "grounding" the LLM and preventing hallucination.
        RetrievalQA Chain: This is a standard LangChain chain that:
           1.Takes the user's question.
           2.Uses the retriever to find relevant document chunks (context).
           3.Inserts the context and question into the prompt_template.
           4.Sends the formatted prompt to the llm.
           5.Returns the LLM's generated answer.
           - chain_type="stuff": This method "stuffs" all retrieved documents directly into the context. Good for a few documents, but can exceed token limits if many/large chunks are retrieved.   Other types like "map_reduce", "refine" exist for handling more context.
             return_source_documents=True: Allows you to see which document chunks were used to generate the answer, which is great for debugging and transparency.

   Basic UX (CLI):
       A simple while loop takes user input and calls chatbot.ask().

   Logging (logging module):
       Provides insights into what the application is doing (loading docs, initializing LLM, retrieved sources, etc.). This is very helpful for debugging.

   Session-Based Memory (ConversationBufferMemory - Optional Extension):
       In the Chatbot class, use_memory=True attempts to enable this.
       ConversationBufferMemory stores the history of the conversation.
       Important Note for RetrievalQA: RetrievalQA itself doesn't inherently use the memory object to feed past conversation turns into the prompt context in a sophisticated way like  ConversationalRetrievalChain does.
       ConversationalRetrievalChain is specifically designed for this. It first takes the current question and the chat history, rephrases the question to be standalone (if needed),
       then performs  retrieval, and finally answers the question based on retrieved docs and current question.
       To make RetrievalQA truly conversational with a custom prompt, you would typically:
          1.Load chat history from memory.
          2.Format it along with the new question.
          3.Pass this combined string as the "query" to RetrievalQA.
            The example shows where you would save to memory, but true conversational flow with RetrievalQA and a specific prompt needs more careful construction of the input to the chain.
            For a  simpler path to conversational RAG, ConversationalRetrievalChain is often preferred, though it gives less direct control over the final QA prompt structure.


 Optional Extensions:
     Trying different vector stores (ChromaDB, Pinecone, etc.).
     Experimenting with different text splitters and chunking strategies.
     Refining the prompt for better responses.
     Implementing ConversationalRetrievalChain for more natural conversation flow.
     Building a more sophisticated UI (e.g., with Streamlit or Flask).
     Adding more advanced ReAct or CoT reasoning if needed for complex queries.
